# noir-bignum

An optimized big number library for Noir.

noir-bignum evaluates modular arithmetic for large integers of any length.

BigNum instances are parametrised by a struct that satisfies BigNumParamsTrait.

Multiplication operations for a 2048-bit prime field cost approx. 930 gates.

bignum can evaluate large integer arithmetic by defining a modulus() that is a power of 2.

## Benchmarks

TODO

## Dependencies

- Noir ≥v0.32.0
- Barretenberg ≥v0.46.1

Refer to [Noir's docs](https://noir-lang.org/docs/getting_started/installation/) and [Barretenberg's docs](https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/blob/master/barretenberg/cpp/src/barretenberg/bb/readme.md#installation) for installation steps.

## Installation

In your _Nargo.toml_ file, add the version of this library you would like to install under dependency:

```
[dependencies]
bignum = { tag = "v0.2.2", git = "https://github.com/noir-lang/noir-bignum" }
```

### Import

Add imports at the top of your Noir code, for example:

```rust
use dep::bignum::fields::U256::U256Params;
use dep::bignum::BigNum;
```

## `bignum`

BigNum members are represented as arrays of 120-bit limbs. The number of 120-bit limbs required to represent a given BigNum object must be defined at compile-time.

If your field moduli is _also_ known at compile-time, use the `BigNumTrait` definition in `lib.nr`

### BigNum struct

Big numbers are instantiated with the BigNum struct:

```rust
struct BigNum<let N: u64, Params> {
    limbs: [Field; N]
}
```

- `N` is the number of `Field` limbs together holding the value of the big number
- `Params` is the parameters associated with the big number; refer to sections below for presets and customizations

### Usage

#### Example

A simple 1 + 2 = 3 check in 256-bit unsigned integers:

```rust
use dep::bignum::fields::U256::U256Params;
use dep::bignum::BigNum;

type U256 = BigNum<3, U256Params>;

fn main() {
    let one: U256 = BigNum::from_array([1, 0, 0]);
    let two: U256 = BigNum::from_array([2, 0, 0]);
    let three: U256 = BigNum::from_array([3, 0, 0]);
    assert((one + two) == three);
}
```

##### Big Unsigned Integers

BigNum supports operations over unsigned integers, with predefined types for 256, 384, 512, 768, 1024, 2048, 4096 and 8192 bit integers.

All arithmetic operations are supported including integer div and mod functions (`udiv`, `umod`). Bit shifts and comparison operators are not yet implemented.

e.g.

```rust
use dep::bignum::fields::U256::U256Params;
use dep::bignum::BigNum;

type U256 = BigNum<3, U256Params>;

fn foo(x: U256, y: U256) -> U256 {
    x.udiv(y)
}
```

##### Fields

`BigNum::fields` contains `BigNumInstance` constructors for common fields.

Feature requests and/or pull requests welcome for missing fields you need.

## `runtime_bignum`

If your field moduli is _not_ known at compile-time (e.g. RSA verification), use the traits and structs defined in `runtime_bignum`: `runtime_bignum::BigNumTrait` and `runtime_bignum::BigNumInstanceTrait`

A `runtime_bignum::BigNumInstance` wraps the bignum modulus (as well as a derived parameter used internally to perform Barret reductions). A `BigNumInstance` object is required to evaluate most bignum operations.

### Types

bignum operations are evaluated using two structs and a trait: `ParamsTrait`, `BigNum<N, MOD_BITS, Params>`, `BigNumInstance<N, MOD_BITS, Params>`

`ParamsTrait` defines the compile-time properties of a BigNum instance: the number of modulus bits and the Barret reduction parameter `k` (TODO: these two values should be the same?!)

`BigNumInstance` is a generator type that is used to create `BigNum` objects and evaluate operations on `BigNum` objects. It wraps BigNum parameters that may not be known at compile time (the `modulus` and a reduction parameter required for Barret reductions (`redc_param`))

The `BigNum` struct represents individual big numbers.

BigNumInstance parameters (`modulus`, `redc_param`) can be provided at runtime via witnesses (e.g. RSA verification). The `redc_param` is only used in unconstrained functions and does not need to be derived from `modulus` in-circuit.

### Usage

#### Example

```rust
use crate::bignum::fields::bn254Fq{BNParams, BN254INSTANCE};
use crate::bignum::runtime_bignum::BigNumInstance;
use crate::bignum::BigNum;

type Fq = BigNum<3, BNParams>;
type FqInst = BigNumInstance<3, BNParams>;

fn example(Fq a, Fq b) -> Fq {
    let instance: FqInst = BN254INSTANCE;
    instance.mul(a, b)
}
```

#### Methods

##### Arithmetics

Basic expressions can be evaluated using `BigNumInstance::add, BigNumInstance::sub, BigNumInstance::mul`. However, when evaluating relations (up to degree 2) that are more complex than single operations, the function `BigNumInstance::evaluate_quadratic_expression` is more efficient (due to needing only a single modular reduction).

##### Unconstrained arithmetics

Unconstrained functions `__mul, __add, __sub, __div, __pow` can be used to compute witnesses that can then be fed into `BigNumInstance::evaluate_quadratic_expression`.

> **Note:** `__div`, `__pow` and `div` are expensive due to requiring modular exponentiations during witness computation. It is worth modifying witness generation algorithms to minimize the number of modular exponentiations required. (for example, using batch inverses)

e.g. if we wanted to compute `(a + b) * c + (d - e) * f = g` by evaluating the above example, `g` can be derived via:

```rust
let bn: BigNumInstance<3, BNParams> = BNInstance();
let t0 = bn.__mul(bn.__add(a, b), c);
let t1 = bn.__mul(bn.__add(d, bn.__neg(e)), f);
let g = bn.__add(t0, t1);
```

See `bignum_test.nr` for more examples.

##### `evaluate_quadratic_expression`

The method `evaluate_quadratic_expression` has the following interface:

```rust
    fn evaluate_quadratic_expression<let LHS_N: u64, let RHS_N: u64, let NUM_PRODUCTS: u64, let ADD_N: u64>(
        self,
        lhs_terms: [[BN; LHS_N]; NUM_PRODUCTS],
        lhs_flags: [[bool; LHS_N]; NUM_PRODUCTS],
        rhs_terms: [[BN; RHS_N]; NUM_PRODUCTS],
        rhs_flags: [[bool; RHS_N]; NUM_PRODUCTS],
        linear_terms: [BN; ADD_N],
        linear_flags: [bool; ADD_N]
    );
```

`NUM_PRODUCTS` represents the number of multiplications being summed (e.g. for `a*b + c*d == 0`, `NUM_PRODUCTS` = 2).

`LHS_N, RHS_N` represents the number of `BigNum` objects being summed in the left and right operands of each product. For example, for `(a + b) * c + (d + e) * f == 0`, `LHS_N = 2`, `RHS_N = 1`.

`ADD_N` represents the number of `BigNum` objects being added into the product (e.g. for `a * b + c + d == 0`, `ADD_N = 2`).

The flag parameters `lhs_flags, rhs_flags, add_flags` define whether an operand in the expression will be negated. For example, for `(a + b) * c + (d - e) * f - g == 0`, we would have:

```rust
let lhs_terms = [[a, b], [d, e]];
let lhs_flags = [[false, false], [false, true]];
let rhs_terms = [[c], [f]];
let rhs_flags = [[false], [false]];
let add_terms = [g];
let add_flags = [true];
BigNum::evaluate_quadratic_expresson(lhs_terms, lhs_flags, rhs_terms, rhs_flags, linear_terms, linear_flags);
```

#### Deriving BigNumInstance parameters: `modulus`, `redc_param`

For common fields, BigNumInstance parameters can be pulled from the presets in `BigNum::fields`.

For other moduli (e.g. those used in RSA verification), both `modulus` and `redc_param` must be computed and formatted according to the following speficiations:

`modulus` represents the BigNum modulus, encoded as an array of `Field` elements that each encode 120 bits of the modulus. The first array element represents the least significant 120 bits.

`redc_param` is equal to `(1 << (2 * Params::modulus_bits())) / modulus` . This must be computed outside of the circuit and provided either as a private witness or hardcoded constant. (computing it via an unconstrained function would be very expensive until noir witness computation times improve)

`double_modulus` is derived via the method `compute_double_modulus` in `runtime_bignum.nr`. If you want to provide this value as a compile-time constant (see `fields/bn254Fq.nr` for an example), follow the algorithm `compute_double_modulus` as this parameter is _not_ structly 2 \* modulus. Each limb except the most significant limb borrows 2^120 from the next most significant limb. This ensure that when performing limb subtractions `double_modulus.limbs[i] - x.limbs[i]`, we know that the result will not underflow.

BigNumInstance parameters can be derived from a known modulus using the rust crate `noir-bignum-paramgen` (https://crates.io/crates/noir-bignum-paramgen)
